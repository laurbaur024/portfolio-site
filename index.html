    <p>Thanks for stopping by my portfolio! My name is Lauren Bleyl. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. We are learning and creating new things each day. I will update this website with new projects as I complete them as well as the new skills that I am learning. Thanks for taking a look at my work!</p>
